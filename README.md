# Cookiecutter template for cluster jobs
- Install `conda install cookiecutter -c conda-forge`
- Run `cookiecutter https://github.com/janclemenslab/cookiecutter_cluster-template.git`. This will ask a couple of questions - the project name will be the name of the folder that will be created for your project at this step. It will also install [fabric]() and [pyyaml]().
- Then open `README.md` in the new folder for further instructions.
